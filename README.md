# Fashion_MNIST-image-classification-using-CNN-
<li>Developed a custom CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model for classifying the images of the fashion_mnist dataset containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.</li>
<li>This dataset consists of 28 x28 grayscale images from ten different classes of fashion clothes.</li>
<li>The different classes are: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot.</li>
<li>The images are stored in the form of pixels with values ranging from 0 to 255.</li>
<li>Accuracy achieved : 93.49%</li>
<li>The total number of correctly and incorrectly classified images was also calculated and the figures for the same are: 9349 and 651. </li>
